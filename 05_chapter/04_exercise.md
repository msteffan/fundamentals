##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

This time around, you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll need to write some functions from scratch, based on the descriptions given below using repl.it's editor.

###Instructions

1. Go ahead an open up a new session in [repl.it](http://repl.it)
2. Write the code for the functions described below, using repl.it's editor window
3. Click 'play' to run the code
4. Try *calling* each function from the console window. Use different parameters to make sure they work as expected.

**Let's get started!**

Write the following functions:
* `sayHello`, which accepts one parameter, called `name`; it should return a greeting to a person with that name, i.e. "Hello, *name*".
* `areBothEven`, which accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`; it should return `true` if `a` and `b` are both even, but `false` otherwise.
* `hotOrNot`, which accepts one parameter, `temp`; it should return `"hot"` if `temp` is above 75, but should return `"not hot"` otherwise.
* `threeIfNull`, which accepts one parameter,`num`. If num is `null`, it should return 3, but otherwise, it should return the value of `num`.
* `greatest`, which accepts three parameters (`x`, `y`, and `z`), and returns the one with the greatest value. For example, `greatest(5,10,1)` would evaluate to 10. HINT: Feel free to use the `compare` function that was provided in the Unit 4 homework as inspiration!

Once you've written and tested all of these functions, go ahead and move on to the next lesson.
