You may have noticed that we neglected to include Antarctica in the `World` directory.

Go ahead and correct this mistake straight from command line:

1. Open up the terminal application

2. Change to the `World` directory within your home directory

3. Make a new directory titled “Antarctica” inside the `World` directory

4. To be sure you created the directory in the right place, list the contents of the `World` directory

5. If you haven't already, change back into the `World` directory 

6. List the contents of South America. There should be three continent directories, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

7. Move the contents of South America into the North America folder

8. Delete the now empty South America directory

9. Change the name of North_America to Americas
