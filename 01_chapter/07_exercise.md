We've gone ahead and created a new directory for you, called <em>World</em>. Download it <a href="http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/assets/activity/World.zip">here</a>.

When you double-click on the zip file, it will create a new folder next to the zip file in your Downloads folder.

Now that you can picture where the file is located, open the Terminal application.

Using the command line alone,

1. Navigate into your `Downloads` directory 

2. Move the `World` directory from `Downloads` to your home directory

3. Check to see if you successfully moved the `World` directory by listing the contents of your home directory

4. Change your working directory to your home directory, and then change to `World`

5. List the contents of the `World` directory

6. In one of the six continents within the `World` directory is a hidden file, `.carmen_sandiego.png`.  Using only the command line, find out where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
