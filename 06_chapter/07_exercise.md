##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Let's go back to the 'checkerboard' code we wrote for the last exercise. This time, you'll be tasked with using what you've just learned about iteration to write a couple of brand new functions:

* `clearBoard()`
  This function will go through every cell in `checkerboard` (see previous exercise) and set that cell's value to `null`.

* `setUpRed()`
  This function will set up the red pieces on our checkerboard by setting the value of each cell that should hold a red piece to `'R'`. For the purposes of this exercise, assume that the red pieces should be laid out at the top of this board, just like in the picture below.

* `setUpBlack()`
  This function should work similarly to `setUpRed`, placing black pieces (`'B'`) on the board at the positions indicated in the picture.

Feel free to us either loops or iterators to write these functions - just make sure that they act *exactly* like the descriptions.
