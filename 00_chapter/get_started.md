**Welcome to WDI Fundamentals**

---

## Join the WDI Community on Slack!

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace and excel in the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors, developers-in-residence, and TAs you work with will often help you drive your own process of discovery, rather than just giving you the right answer.

You're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. For now, we encourage you to connect with your instructor and classmates via Slack, a real time messaging application. To sign on to Slack, first check your email for an invitation from your producer.

Next, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com/signin), enter "ga-students" where the page asks for your team domain, and join the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel to meet your global classmates!

## Getting Help

By the time you've completed Fundamentals, you will have built a game in JavaScript which you can run on the command line. You'll also have the chance to connect with an online mentor to get feedback on your code. You don't need to do anything now (we'll remind you at the end of Fundamentals), but you can read more about GA Mentors [here](../07_feedback/intro.md).
