**Welcome to WDI Fundamentals**

---

## Join the WDI Community on Slack!

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors with whom you work will often help you drive your own process of discovery, rather than just give you the right answer. You'll also learn to rely on your classmates for support and structure.

You're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a coffee shop, so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. For now, we encourage you to connect with your classmates via Slack, a real-time messaging application you'll be using in class.

To sign on to Slack, first check your email for an invitation from your producer.

Be sure to add a photo and "WDI Student - CITY" to your profile.

Next, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com/signin), enter "ga-students" where the
page asks for your team domain, and join the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel to meet your global classmates!

## Getting Help

By the time you've completed Fundamentals, you will have built a game in
JavaScript, which you can run on the command line. You'll also have the chance to
connect with an online mentor to get feedback on your code. You don't need to do
anything now (we'll remind you at the end of Fundamentals), but you can read more
about GA Mentors [here](../07_feedback/intro.md).
